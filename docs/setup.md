# Setup

Apologies I shall only cover **Mac** - One day I may include Linux and Windows.

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for easy package management on Mac:

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Install essentials:

```shell
brew install git
brew install --cask gitkraken
```

Other useful installations:

```shell
brew cask install virtualbox
brew cask install docker
brew install httpie
brew install thefuck
```
